# Database-System-for-DNA-Sequences

Database system for DNA Sequences is a project that implements a simple database system for DNA sequences using binary tree data structure in C++, where the DNA sequences are stored indirectly in the binary tree as sequence identifiers(integer) and conversions are made to print the actual DNA Sequence.
